# Online Shopping System â€“ UML Diagrams

This repository contains **Component**, **Deployment**, and **Collaboration (Communication)** diagrams created for an **Online Shopping System** as part of system design and modeling practice.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The objective of this project is to visually represent the architecture and interaction flow of an online shopping platform using **UML (Unified Modeling Language)**. These diagrams help in understanding:

- **System components and their relationships**
- **Physical deployment of software modules**
- **Communication flow between actors and system objects**
